    "description": "Quiz Description",
    "show_results": true,
    "randomize": true,
    "questions": [...]
}
```

### Question Examples

{
    "id": 1,
    "type": "single_choice",
    "question": "What is the capital of France?",
    "options": {
        "a": "London",
        "b": "Berlin",
        "c": "Paris",
        "d": "Madrid"
    },
    "correct_answers": ["c"],
    "points": 2
}
```
